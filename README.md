# week-2-portfolio-challenge

Task: To build my own portfolio website:

Link to deployed application:

https://kedmead91.github.io/week-2-portfolio-challenge/

To meet each of the acceptance criterias below I have done the following tasks.

1 - I formatted the html so that all the information I needed on my site was structured into the right semantic elements.

2 - I used css to style my website to make it stand out and easier to read. 

3 - I made my website more responsive to adapt to smaller screens using media queries.

What I found Easy:

I found the nav bar the easiest to style and structure and I enjoyed stylign the nav and hero section.

What I found Hard:
I found structuring the project one image hard as it needed to be a bigger size so that took me a while to work out how to make it bigger while keeping the other items on a different line but after reasearching previous lessons and refering to the mdn documents I worked it out.
I also found it took me a while to stop the other projects from staying on one line but in the end I worked out how to get 2 projects per 1 line in desktop view.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
